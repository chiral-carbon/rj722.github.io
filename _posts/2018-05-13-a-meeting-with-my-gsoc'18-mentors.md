Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn. This
blog post is a public memoir of an online meeting I had with my GSoC mentors.
Kudos to me for having such awesome mentors! :P

So, a few days back I see some sudden activity in
[vulture](https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture) with a lot of questions and
ideas from the legendary [@AbdealiJK](https://github.com/AbdealiJK). I had
already known him because of his contributions to [coala](https://coala.io). But
to my surprise, a week down, I come to know that he is mentoring me for my GSoC
project: ["Automatic Whitelist generation for
vulture"](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5620743946108928) along
with [@jendrikseipp](https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture) and
[@The-Compiler](https://github.com/The-Compiler).

Now, since we wanted everyone to be on the same page and catch up with the
developments in the project, we planned to have a kick off call. All of us
quickly marked our free time on a [doodle
calendar](https://doodle.com/poll/hn5dibfgz2y63ssa#calendar) and thereby decided
to have the call on May 4 (08:00 PM). In the meanwhile, [a protest caught up
momentum in my college](https://twitter.com/hashtag/westandwithamu) and seeking
to it, government shut down Internet services in my town, Aligarh on May 4 (The
nuances of it's repercussions are yet to be lamented by). While, I was somehow
still being able to surf the Internet, I quickly notified Abdeali and asked for
his number so that if I couldn't access Internet, I would notify him through
SMS. But, it must have been a bad day for humanity for not only did I lose
Internet, I had such an abrupt network connection in my mobile phone, that
sending an SMS took a couple hours.


It was bound to happen, but I was lucky that exams were postponed from May 7 to
May 12, and that we could reschedule the meeting to happen on May 7 now. Yay!
:-)

_May 7, 7:30 PM_: I'm all set with audio/video equipment and make a hangout call
to my friend to ensure that everything was indeed working. (Thanks
[@proishan11](https://github.com/proishan11))

_May 7, 7:35 PM_: I've already joined the call. Eagerly waiting for everyone!

_May 7, 7:48 PM_: I e-mail the hangout link to everyone and create a Google doc
for notes and share it with everyone.

_May 7, 7:55 PM_: Florian joins the call, tells me that he is sitting a
StarBucks cafe right now and that he was on mobile and that he would be joining
the call right back with his computer.

_May 7, 8:00 PM_: Abdeali and Jendrik join the call, and that point marked the
point where we embark on our journey of GSoC 2018. Let me walk you through it.

## GSoC Kick-off

As soon as they join the call, we have a casual conversation about t-shirts,
protests and politics all the while we were waiting for Florian to join the
call.

We start with have a round of introduction:

- Abdeali:
	- We should call him Ali.
	- Works in a startup based in Bangalore, India.
	- Have had been a GSoC student twice.

- Jendrik:
	- Based in Basel, Switzerland
	- Completed his PhD in Artificial Intelligence from University of Basel.
	- Currently a postdoctoral researcher at the same place.

- Florian
	- Software Engineering Student
	- Maintainer of [qutebrowser](https://github.com/qutebrowser)
	- Has very long hair. (<3)


After the introductions, we discuss about what common communication medium
should we use and finally arrive on a consensus that we should be using mailing
lists for elaborate discourse and IRC (#vulture on irc.freenode.org) for more
real time dialogue.

We then have a brief discussion about examinations, vacation plans, etc. to mark
our availability. I also became a subject of pity when I told them the truth of
my monotonous life: No Vacation, No pilgrimage! :-( (I really should plan a
vacation!)

In the meanwhile, Jendrik notices that someone has had been taking notes in the
[Google
Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TltVoSFNxfjuiKTM8tnYmMllc6Z7GfmvJNIePWKgp6M/edit?usp=sharing) -
We find out that it's Florian. I am totally taken aback by his ability to
listen, process, speak and type at the same time. Hats off! - It is one of the
reason that I've started learning touch typing.

After a few more rounds of discussions, following verdicts are pronounced:
- No dedicated traces, use coverage.py output
- Have the coverage tracing thing in the same repository as vulture
- But use a different repo for the whitelist generator.
- **Jendrik does not have exams and is very happy about it.**.

After all of this crazy fun for 40 mins, it was time that we bid each other good
bye. But all in all, it was a great experience (and productive) to be finally
able to meet with mentors and to see some faces behind the names. :-) Thank You
everyone for making this possible.
