Here's my work progress with the first phase of Google Summer of Code 2018.

## Goals

There were two primary goals to be achieved:

- Create a tool which would to create whitelists for projects using [`sip`][1] (eg. `PyQt`).
- Maximise test coverage for [Vulture](https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture).

# Vulture-Whitelist

Idea was to create a tool for people running Vulture analysis on projects using [`sip`][1]
to create Python bingings for C/C++ code.

### Problem

Consider a scenario where a user imports a class in Python, defined through a C++ module. Now,
if the user decides to overload any virtual function of that class - It won't  be executed by Python *directly*.
Thus, leaving no way to determine beforehand if that particular method is used anytime,
thus causing static analysis tools, like Vulture to report them as unused.

### Proposed Solution

The most obvious solution is parse virtual functions present in `sip` files and write them
to a file which could then be included in the list of files to be analysed by Vulture which would then inturn
treat these methods as if they are used, thus preventing Vulture from reporting
them as unused.

It has one caveat though - The results may contain a false negative when there is an overloaded
method which isn't run anytime because Vulture would consider it as "used" anyways, but nonetheless
given that projects like PyQt (the main consumer of `sip`) have thousands of virtual functions,
it would still be better to negotiate a false negative than a false positive.

Gladly, `sip` already provided us with a way to export data in XML format, and in no time
[@The-Compiler][compiler] [merged a patch][patch] so that XML includes a `virtual="(1|0)"`
attribute for Function tag and he quickly implemented a [script][script] to parse the XML
and filter out all virtual functions and save them as a whitelist.

My job was to create a plugin based python package as a wrapper around that script because there
are multiple generators for creating bindings and we would want to support many of them
incrementally. [`vulture-whitelist`][vw] can be found [here][vw].

# Code Coverage

Vulture had an excellent code coverage of `95%` prior to my stride on
maximizing the coverage ratio. At first, [Jendrik][jendrik] thought that achieving `100%`
wouldn't be possible without major changes in how the tests were currently written. But,
after inspecting the coverage report closely we found out that only a minor tweaks and
removal of some obsolete code did the job. It also unveiled a bug in how the tests for
`async` functions were written - They weren't even being run because of a [faulty fixture
I wrote.][fixture]

Now, after the successful culmination of the first phase, I look forward to working on
an entirely new feature on Vulture - Dynamic Analysis for detecting false positives. Stay
tuned for more info.
