Getting selected as a Google Summer of Code student with coala was a
breakthrough for me. The coala community touched me on every aspect of open
source software development, especially how to get along with peers (and troll
them :-p). And it has happened again - I am a student with coala one more time,
and I look forward to learn yet more from my dear mentors and the beloved coala
community.

Let me give a brief overview of the project I would be working on: The aim is to
automatically create whitelists (to be utilized by
[vulture](https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture)) for projects using sip files
to communicate between C++ level API and Python programs, most significant of
them being PyQt projects.

### ACTION PLAN

* Create a script which takes sip files as input and spits a whitelist with all
  the virtual functions defined in the sip files. (Add Documentation and tests)
* Use that script for generating a whitelist for popular projects using PyQt
  (like [qutebrowser](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser)).
* Allow passing coverage.xml to vulture via `--make-whitelist` and let it find
  the list of false-positive functions. (Add Documentation and tests as well)
* Write a whitelist generator for `shiboken`, the binding generator used for
  PySide2
