## About me

I am Rahul Jha (~ RJ722). I am currently studying Electronics Engineering at <a
href="https://www.amu.ac.in/principal.jsp?did=10147">Zakir Husain College of
Engineering and Technology</a>

> I learn, I write, I speak - It's mostly about open source, python or robotics.

### Robotics
I took up Engineering because of my passion for Autonomous Robots - They
fascinate me, leave me overwhelmed every time I realise the complicated
intricacies of machinery which empowers our brain.

### Open Source
Other than learning/pondering about Robots, I help maintain <a
href="https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture">vulture</a>, a tool which
helps find dead code in Python Programs, and <a href="coala.io">coala</a>, a
language independent static analysis tool and a linter.

I was a <a
href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/projects/5154725527814144/">Google
Summer of Code student</a> with coala in 2017 and again in 2018, wherein I
worked on [ Vulture ](https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture) - which was
a great experience.

I believe that pursuing open source is one of the best ways I can give back to
the society, passing on what I learned.

### Reading

I like to learn new things and that is why I read, a lot about tech and yet more
about the open source movement. I also like to read about history, otherwise I
believe we're just going around in circles. I also like poetry and plan to start
reading fiction soon.

### Meetups and Conferences

I've a lot of fun at conferences - whether I am an attendee or an organizer,
either way I get to meet and learn from like minded people. I also host regular
meetups through AMU-OSS, where anyone from the audience is welcome to come and
speak about whatever she's been working on lately.

I was invited as a speaker in PyCon India 2017 where I spoke about **"Reducing
Dead Code Ratio of Python Projects using vulture"**. In the same conference, I
also delivered a lightening talk on **"coala - What, Why and How?"** and met quite a
few celebrities in the Python community and made a lot of friends during the
same conference.

I also gave a similar talk, titled **"Scavenging Dead Code using Vulture"** at
DevConf, India 2018 and was also invited to DevConf, Czech but could not visit
due to logistics.

### Other 'fun' facts about me

I love tweaking themes and desktop environments until I make them ugly.

I can touch type with an average speed of around 60-65 WPM.

I like Urdu shayari.
