<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>

<p>I am Rahul Jha (~ RJ722). I am currently studying Electronics Engineering at <a href="https://www.amu.ac.in/principal.jsp?did=10147">Zakir Husain College of
Engineering and Technology</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I learn, I write, I speak - It’s mostly about open source, python or robotics.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="robotics">Robotics</h3>
<p>I took up Engineering because of my passion for Autonomous Robots - They
fascinate me, leave me overwhelmed every time I realise the complicated
intricacies of machinery which empowers our brain.</p>

<h3 id="open-source">Open Source</h3>
<p>Other than learning/pondering about Robots, I help maintain <a href="https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture">vulture</a>, a tool which
helps find dead code in Python Programs, and <a href="coala.io">coala</a>, a
language independent static analysis tool and a linter.</p>

<p>I was a <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/projects/5154725527814144/">Google
Summer of Code student</a> with coala in 2017 and again in 2018, wherein I
worked on <a href="https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture"> Vulture </a> - which was
a great experience.</p>

<p>I believe that pursuing open source is one of the best ways I can give back to
the society, passing on what I learned.</p>

contributing to open source software, write to me straight away at <a
href="malito:rahul722j@gmail.com">rahul722j [AT] gmail [DOT] com</a>.
-->

<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>

<p>I like to learn new things and that is why I read, a lot about tech and yet more
about the open source movement. I also like to read about history, otherwise I
believe we’re just going around in circles. I also like poetry and plan to start
reading fiction soon.</p>

<h3 id="meetups-and-conferences">Meetups and Conferences</h3>

<p>I’ve a lot of fun at conferences - whether I am an attendee or an organizer,
either way I get to meet and learn from like minded people. I also host regular
meetups through AMU-OSS, where anyone from the audience is welcome to come and
speak about whatever she’s been working on lately.</p>

<p>I was invited as a speaker in PyCon India 2017 where I spoke about <strong>“Reducing
Dead Code Ratio of Python Projects using vulture”</strong>. In the same conference, I
also delivered a lightening talk on <strong>“coala - What, Why and How?”</strong> and met quite a
few celebrities in the Python community and made a lot of friends during the
same conference.</p>

<p>I also gave a similar talk, titled <strong>“Scavenging Dead Code using Vulture”</strong> at
DevConf, India 2018 and was also invited to DevConf, Czech but could not visit
due to logistics.</p>

<h3 id="other-fun-facts-about-me">Other ‘fun’ facts about me</h3>

<p>I love tweaking themes and desktop environments until I make them ugly.</p>

<p>I can touch type with an average speed of around 60-65 WPM.</p>

<p>I like Urdu shayari.</p>
