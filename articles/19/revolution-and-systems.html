      <h1>Silk Road, Revolutions and Systems</h1>
<p class="subtitle">May 26, 2019</p>

<p>Today, I read the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/04/silk-road-1/">story of Silk Road</a> - How an idealist, Ross
Ulbricht, tired of chasing success the old school way, found his way around
creating an online <label for="sn-id-darknet" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-darknet" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">As a part of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet">darkweb</a>, it was operated as a Tor hidden service which protects
personal privacy of users by concealing their details from anyone conducting
network surveillance, from Government to their ISP. Additionally, all payments
were made using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin"> Bitcoin </a>, a cryptocurrency which provides a certain
degree of anonymity. </span> bazaar for trading of illicit materials, mainly drugs,
which he named Silk Road.</p>

<p>The aim behind writing this blog post was to think out loud and trying to build
an insight into the oversight of some of the most prominent revolutionaries of
the past.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>When operating his online empire, Ross would take on the identity of Dread
Pirate Roberts (~DPR) (borrowing the name from The Princess Bride, in which the
pirate was a mythical character, inhabited by the wearer of the mask).</p>

<p>Ross (aka DPR) was having trouble switching back-and-forth between these
different personalities, the many different facets of which were penned down
beautifully <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/04/silk-road-1/">in the original article </a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To Alex, Ross was the cool new roommate; to Julia [his on-and-off girlfriend],
a passionate lover and inspiration; to his family, the perpetual Eagle Scout;
to Force [undercover DEA Agent posing as a Puerto Rican cartel middlemen], an
unlikely friend in the night; to Tarbell [FBI Agent investigating his case], a
smart kid defeated by his own arrogance. To the Southern District of New York
US attorney’s office, Ross was simply the criminal conspirator Dread Pirate
Roberts.</p>

  <p>The likeliest reality is that Ross was all of those things. The open-minded
seeker who conscientiously tried to pluck trash from a tree was Ross. As was
the feverish visionary creating a virtual empire at any cost. Neither truth
invalidated the other. Ross and DPR can (and did) coexist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even until now, if you haven’t read the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/04/silk-road-1/">story</a>, please do! - It is
one of the most interesting and riveting cyber-criminology reports I’ve ever read.</p>

<p>Coming back, well, Ross didn’t exactly dream of building this huge empire of
illicit business, but it was essentially all baby steps,
<label for="sn-id-baby" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-baby" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">As B.J. Neblett said “We are the sum total of our experiences. Those
experiences – be they positive or negative – make us the person we are, at any
given point in our lives. And, like a flowing river, those same experiences, and
those yet to come, continue to influence and reshape the person we are, and the
person we become. None of us are the same as we were yesterday, nor will be
tomorrow.” </span>
rooting back to the influence Ludwig von Mises, an Austrian economist who was
described by the story as “a totem of the modern American libertarian
orthodoxy”, had on Ross. According to von Mises, a citizen must have economic
freedom to be politically or morally free.</p>

<p>Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler and Ludwig von Mises - They all had an ideology - a
vision of the ideal world, a way of bringing peace to world - an expression
which society must adhere to lead them towards the state of utter completeness
and happiness.</p>

<p>The ideology of Hitler was of an ideology of conquest: the “manifest destiny” of
a superior race to conquer, occupy, and control lands of the “lesser” people,
the <em>Untermenschen</em>, for the sole benefit of the superior race.</p>

<p>The ideal society for Stalin was the one in which people contribute to it
because they feel it is their pleasure and responsibility to do so, and in which
people only consume what they need, while mindful of the needs of others.</p>

<p>And they executed their ideas, bringing about their ‘revolution’!</p>

<p>Both the regimes - The Third Reich and Stalinism were responsible for millions
of deaths and for untold amounts of suffering.</p>

<p>Although one can argue that the ‘revolution’ of Ross was nowhere even near their
scale, but that is immaterial to this discussion. It followed the same
pattern which was summed up by Bearman, the author of the original story, rather
well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s an age-old story, the bloom and wilt of revolution. After tearing down
the establishment’s walls, the new regime soon realizes the rubble would make
a fine set of gallows. Just as Tarbell thought, all systems are the same. At
the beginning of Silk Road, what Ross created was just a system. Then, at a
certain point, it became his system—at which moment the system was doomed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Isn’t it strange - How we become the very thing we fight against!</em></p>

<p><label for="mf-id-abyss" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="mf-id-abyss" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/assets/img/abyss.jpg" /><br />Gazing into Abyss</span></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Beware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster…
for when you gaze long into the abyss. The abyss gazes also into you.”</p>

  <p>― Friedrich W. Nietzsche</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For people who prefer fiction over history, what happened with the <a href="https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Season_8">finale of
Game of Thrones</a> was a prime example of this notion. [Spoilers Ahead]
In light of everything Daenerys [one of show’s main protagonists] accomplished —
birthing dragons out of stone, freeing thousands of slaves, helping the Starks
defeat an army of ice-zombies — the viewers first handedly experienced the
mindset of a revolutionary who decided that they need to liberate the entire
world. Yet, it was when she failed to draw a line between herself and her vision
<label for="sn-id-dany" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-dany" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The time when she succumbed to her temptations,
killing thousands of people in King’s Landing </span>, that she failed as a ruler, becoming exactly
what she came to abolish - tyranny. It is worth noting here that all the while
she burned innocent people, she was fueled by the exact same idea - to liberate
the world from tyranny.</p>

<p>In Ross’s case, the fact that he was feeling unease even as DPR (who was a
rather confident and eloquent character) was the first clue that the shadows of
the doom had already fallen across him - that he had already begun failing
what he had intended to do, but he deceived himself in the name of his idea - in
the belief that he was doing the <em>right thing</em>.</p>

<p>Is it really this belief and total devotion to your idea that blinds us, or is
it the power and the riches which corrupts us or maybe it is a fundamental
misunderstanding of our very own conceived idea? It might as well be some skewed
combination of all of the above, maybe?</p>

<p>I do not claim that I know the answers to all, or any, of the questions above.</p>

<p>But let’s look through another revolutionary, Mahatma Gandhi and the revolution
he brought about in India.</p>

<p><label for="mf-id-gandhi" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="mf-id-gandhi" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/assets/img/gandhi.jpg" /><br />Mahatma Gandhi was
called Bapu (Father) by many, including Jawaharlal Nehru</span></p>

<p>In response to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowlatt_Act">Rowlatt Act</a> brought by the British and the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jallianwala_Bagh_massacre">Jallianwala Bagh Massacre</a>, Gandhi lead the non-cooperation
movement appealing people to to adopt swadeshi goods and local handicrafts and
to refuse to buy British goods. The movement was based on the principle of
<em>Ahimsa</em> (Non-Violence), and after two years of hard work, it gained full
momentum in 1922. It seemed that the dream of <em>Swaraj</em> (self-governance) was
finally near.</p>

<p>But giving a face to Gandhi’s fears, the cases of violence were reported from
all over the nation, and after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauri_Chaura_incident">Chauri-Chaura</a>
<label for="sn-id-chauri" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-chauri" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">A large group of protesters, participating in the
Non-cooperation movement, clashed with police, who opened fire. In retaliation,
the demonstrators attacked and set fire to a police station, killing all of its
occupants. </span>
incident, he decided to call off the protest single-handedly. This was indeed a
very difficult and brave decision on his part - he could have got what he wanted
ignoring these ‘mild’ cases of violence for the nation, but his moral cadre was
defiant of such a behavior and he chose to voice it.</p>

<p>It was perhaps because he believed in a perpetual fight, a fight we
all have to fight against our own moral demons, and that the nation must not
resort to the demon of violence.</p>

<p>Subsequently, Gandhi launched many such campaigns perfecting the concept of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyagraha"><em>Satyagrah</em></a> <label for="sn-id-satyagrah" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-satyagrah" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">सत्याग्रह (Satyagrah):
सत्य (Truth) + आग्रह (insistence) - सत्य के लिए आग्रह - <em>The truth force</em>, is a
particular form of non-violent civil resistance </span> finally leading the nation
to independence in 1947.</p>

<p>I guess we all get to play Ross sometimes, and I believe that creating moral
barriers, as Gandhi did, to encourage the high moral regard of one’s own
values - be it a ruthless round of questioning one’s very own beliefs and
biases, or having an external support mechanism for keeping oneself on track -
would help us dodge the doom of our system.</p>

<p>But, I do find it very interesting to ponder upon how ‘easy’ it is to be
lost, to be engrossed so deeply into your vision to forget what it stood for in
the first place, to cross the rather fine line drawn between us and the monster.
And how tools like identities, the different masks we wear, makes it all the
more easier.</p>
