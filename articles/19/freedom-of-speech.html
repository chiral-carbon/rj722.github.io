<p class="subtitle">May 22, 2019</p>

<p>Right to Free Speech is essential for a democracy. This blog post aims to shed
some light on the recent authoritarian attempts made by hindutva-right-wing to
curb free speech and how can we fight back.</p>

<h3 id="indias-divider-in-chief"><em>“India’s Divider in chief”</em></h3>

<p>TIME magazine, in it’s May 20 edition, featured the Prime Minister of India, Mr.
Narendra Damodardas <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/indias-divider-in-chief-pm-modi-features-on-time-magazine-cover-5720637/">Modi on it’s cover page</a></p>

<p><label for="mf-id-modi19" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="mf-id-modi19" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="https://i.imgur.com/necOF1d.jpg" /><br />The photo, which appeared rather grim, was tagged <code class="highlighter-rouge">India's Divider in Chief</code></span></p>

<p>The article opens with the sentence:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Of the great democracies to fall to populism, India was the first.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Under Prime Minister Modi, the story read,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Nation’s most basic norms, such as the character of the Indian state, its
founding fathers, the place of minorities and its institutions, from
universities to corporate houses to the media, were shown to be severely
distrusted.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Furthering the argument, it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“…Under Modi, minorities of every stripe – from liberals and lower castes to
Muslims and Christians – have come under assault”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It talked about the promise of the economic reform of the messiah which has
failed to materialize and how “he [the BJP] is lucky to be blessed with so weak
an opposition–a ragtag coalition of parties, led by the Congress, with no agenda
other than to defeat him</p>

<p>But, we aren’t here to debate this. Let’s look at the before and aftermath of
the incident.</p>

<p><strong>2012</strong></p>

<p><label for="mf-id-manmohan" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="mf-id-manmohan" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="http://img.timeinc.net/time/images/covers/asia/2012/20120716_600.jpg" /><br />Manmohan Singh featured on one of the 2012 editions of the same magazine</span></p>

<p>In 2012, Manmohan Singh appeared on the cover of the same magazine as <em>“The
Underachiever”</em>, even which might have been an understatement at the time.</p>

<p>Many of BJP supporters including but not limited to their leader
<a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bjp-attacks-manmohan-after-time-magazine-report/article3616536.ece#!">Ravi Shankar Prasad, without a shred of doubt on the authenticity of the
article, straight away demanded his resignation</a> on the grounds
that the image of India has been spoiled.</p>

<p><label for="mf-id-modi12" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="mf-id-modi12" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3d/8f/69/3d8f69a98f3fdeef9359d8a1ef7b49ba.jpg" /><br />Narendra Modi appears for the first time on the cover page of TIME, highlighted positively - <code class="highlighter-rouge">Modi means business</code></span></p>

<p>A subsequent edition of TIME in 2012 again showed interest in Indian economy
featuring Modi on cover page entitled “Modi means business” - enforcing the
dream BJP instilled in Indians of the economic reform it promised.</p>

<p><strong>2015</strong></p>

<p><label for="mf-id-modi15" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="mf-id-modi15" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftimedotcom.files.wordpress.com%2F2015%2F05%2Findia-final.jpg&amp;w=800&amp;c=sc&amp;poi=face&amp;q=85" /><br />Modi, now Prime Minister, appeared once again on the cover page of TIME. This time, it said <code class="highlighter-rouge">Why Modi Matters</code></span></p>

<p>And again in 2015, Modi was featured, this time as the Prime Minister. The tag
line said “Why Modi Matters” depicting Modi government positively.</p>

<p>Apart from this, he was also rewarded a place in the list of “The 100 Most
Influential People” by (yes, you guessed it right) TIME in 2014, 2015 and 2017
editions.</p>

<p>Up until now, all in favour, all good - Lo and behold, TIME magazine is the best
magazine in the world.</p>

<p><strong>2019</strong></p>

<p>The trend line of TIME on the opinion on Narendra Modi is very similar to the
change of opinion of people, slowly declining until 2017 and a much steeper fall
after that. The cover page of 2019 is a simple depiction of that, but now the
complaints begin.</p>

<h3 id="controversy-behind-pakistani-writer">Controversy behind Pakistani Writer</h3>

<p>The author of article, Mr. Aatish Taseer is a Pakistani Journalist. Following the
release of the magazine, his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aatish_Taseer&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=896408874&amp;oldid=896403743">wikipedia page was severly vandalized</a> - stating
that he writes against Brahmins, is a member of Lashkar-E-Tayabba, a pakistani
militant group and that he is also working as a PR manager for Congress.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Wikipedia page of Aatish vandalized</figcaption><img src="/assets/img/ateesh-wiki.png" /></figure>
<figure><figcaption></figcaption><img src="/assets/img/ateesh-wiki2.png" /></figure>

<p>This false information was then tweeted numerous times as widespread propaganda
by some trolls on the internet. Other means to defame him were also adopted.</p>

<p><label for="mf-id-aatish" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="mf-id-aatish" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="https://i.imgur.com/9d2Z78v.jpg" /><br />One of many fake TIME cover created by trolls for defaming Aatish</span></p>

<p>One thing worth noting here is that yes, the author actually is half-pakistani
(born to an Indian mother, Mrs. Tavleen Singh and a Pakistani father, Mr. Salmaan
Taseer). In fact, Mr. Salmaan was one of the most liberal politicians of Pakistan,
leading to his <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/01/04/pakistans-dangerous-blasphemy-laws-claim-the-governor-of-punjab/">assassination in 2011 because of his strong opinions on Blasphemy
Laws in Pakistan</a> and his mother, <a href="https://twitter.com/tavleen_singh/status/1126665638582177792">Mrs. Tavleen appeers to be a Modi supporter</a>.</p>

<p>This was the journey of the TIME magazine - from being used as a source for
asking resignation of a Prime Minster in 2012 to being stamped as an
anti-nationalist, anti-hindu, pro-Pakistani and pro-Congress magazine - which
cannot be trusted at all.</p>

<h2 id="the-rise-of-authoritarianism">The Rise of authoritarianism</h2>

<p>For the past few years, there has been a shift in governance model and their
policy and stance on failures - furthering more and more towards
authoritarianism. Anyone who dare questions them or speaks against them is
drafted ‘anti-national’ and crazy as it might sound - ‘anti-hindu’. First comes
hate speech, death threats and trolling for propaganda. Even then, if someone
doesn’t stop, then, if they are lucky, <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/sedition-case-registered-against-arundhati-roy-geelani-440611">they are charged with sedition</a> <label for="sn-id-sedition" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-sedition" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Arundhati Roy, Kanhaiya Kumar, Umar Khalid, Aseem
Trivedi are just a few famous names who have been charged with sedition,
primarily because they spoke against the ruling party. It’s ironic that this
draconian law was used by the British to suppress the freedom movement. </span>, or
else they are <a href="https://www.india.com/news/india/jnu-row-pro-bjp-lawyers-admit-thrashing-kanhaiya-kumar-inside-police-custody-till-he-wet-his-pants-watch-video-971691/">either dealt with violence</a> - <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/jnu-kanhaiya-kumar-patiala-house-court-lawyers-media-attacked/">lynched by a mob </a>,

officials would then put up a huge mournful act to).</p>

<p>The cases for all these victims was made further down by defaming them across
mainstream media portraying them as criminals or associating them with terrorist
organizations, which brings me to my second point…</p>

<h2 id="freedom-of-the-press">Freedom of The Press</h2>

<p>It isn’t just the voice of the student leaders and activists which is silenced,
but even the mainstream media journalists are being denied their right to free
speech.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anyone-speaking-against-bjp-rss-is-silenced-sonia-rahul-on-gauri-lankesh-s-murder/story-Z240UB6qkxJnzcTD9rzYmO.html">Gauri Lankesh, one of the top political journalists of India was shot dead
outside her house</a> because she was an outspoken critic of
right-wing-‘hindutva’-politics and was present at the forefront of many
protests, including the protest against the smearing of Kannada writer Yogesh
Master’s face with black ink.</p>

<p>When Punya Prasun Bajpayi, in his show <em>Masterstroke</em> uncovered some false
claims made by Prime Minister regarding a rural lady by interviewing her, TV
screens <a href="https://scroll.in/article/889026/resignations-of-two-journalists-at-abp-news-cause-disquiet-in-newsrooms-and-far-beyond">were blackened out</a> for the consequent episodes for his show in many
parts of the nation. This political pressure on ABP news further lead to
<a href="https://scroll.in/article/889026/resignations-of-two-journalists-at-abp-news-cause-disquiet-in-newsrooms-and-far-beyond">resignation of ABP’s network managing editor, Milind Khandekar</a>, closely
followed by Bajpayi’s own. After this round of resignations, another journalist
at the network <a href="https://www.newslaundry.com/shorts/abp-news-abhisar-sharma-resigns">Abhisar Sharma went for leave</a> and <a href="https://www.newslaundry.com/shorts/abp-news-abhisar-sharma-resigns">finally resigned a few
days later</a>.</p>

<p>This is an organized attack on media, disrupting any dialogue or questions in
the matter of starvation deaths, unemployment, education affairs, farmer
suicides, clean air and water.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/modi-interviews-packed-with-lines-rg-could-never-get-away-with-2037244">scripted interviews</a> which our Prime Minister gives, all the
while bluntly <a href="https://www.thequint.com/elections/social-dangal/incredible-liar-twitter-pm-modi-email-digital-camera-1988">blurting out lies, gibberish</a> and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/05/laughing-matter-india-modi-mocked-tech-gaffes-190513091851774.html">factually incorrect
statements</a>, would be comprised of questions aimed at reinforcing the
propaganda amongst the masses.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<figure class="fullwidth"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/EQRoyEe.jpg" /><figcaption>This is a mainstream media
house - The job of these 'journalists' has crumbled to the extent that they now
spend time on Kim Jong Un's wives rather than questioning or analyzing
government policies, creating awareness or showing statistics about the current
unemployment in India.</figcaption></figure>

<p><br /></p>

<p>India currently <a href="https://rsf.org/en/india">ranks 140 out of 180 countries on World Press Freedom
Index</a>, which is a disaster for the world’s largest democracy.</p>

who haven’t yet forgotten what journalism is and and still have the courage to raise the right
questions):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ask questions. Questioning government is the highest service to the nation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faiz_Ahmad_Faiz">Faiz Ahmad Faiz</a>, one of the most celebrated poets in Urdu literature,
who was also a protagonist of the Progressive Movement of India (1936), wrote
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazm">nazm</a>: <em>“Bol ke Lab Aazad Hain Tere”</em> <label for="sn-id-safdar-hashmi" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-safdar-hashmi" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">When Safdar Hashmi, who later became a symbol of cultural resistance against
authoritarianism for the Indian left, was murdered while performing his
street-play ‘Halla Bol’ (Attack), Faiz’s nazm served a rallying cry for the
protestors with each line followed by chanting ‘Halla Bol’. </span> (English: Speak,
for your lips are free), <a href="https://kashmirlife.net/famous-faiz-poem-bol-ki-lab-azad-hein-teray-was-for-sheikh-abdullah-193424/">possibly in the wake of Kashmir Liberation
Movement</a> dedicated to his friend and renowned music composer
Arshad Mahmud, who was also his student and compatriot.</p>

<p>This nazm couldn’t be any more relevant today. Have a read for yourself (English translation below):</p>

appeal that we, the citizens of India speak out, question the government, and
spread awareness amongst our fellows citizens our rights.</p>
