<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p><span class="newthought">As</span>  you might have noticed during the past few days, on the
recommendation of my mentor and a dear friend, <a href="https://janusworx.com/">Jason Braganza</a>, I have
been trying to push beyond my boundaries and trying to get some rust off of this
blog.</p>

<p>I also thought that this was a nice opportunity to get myself out of my comfort
zone and write about different themes which I had always enjoyed reading but
never really dread to write about, things like politics and philosophy.</p>

<p><label for="mf-id-xkcd" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="mf-id-xkcd" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/machine_learning.png" /><br />There’s an xkcd for everything</span></p>

<p>Although I really enjoyed nearly every part of such writing: churning out
research material, looking for counter statements, understanding the argument as
a whole &amp; putting it all together, etc., but I find that to put together a
rather convincing post, it takes up a lot of time and effort, something which my
upcoming schedule wouldn’t allow.</p>

<p>Instead, I’ve come up with a new scheme. I am currently revising the first few
courses of the popular online specialization taught by Andrew Ng,
<a href="https://deeplearning.ai">deeplearning.ai</a> and this blog serves as a great opportunity to digitize my
notes and making them publicly available.</p>

<p>And the selfish reason behind me doing this “noble task” is best <a href="https://hackernoon.com/interview-with-deep-learning-researcher-and-leader-of-openmined-andrew-trask-77cd33570a8c">summarized by 
Andrew Trask</a>, who is a DeepMind Researcher and a Ph.D. student at
Oxford University. He’s also the author of the amazing book: Grokking Deep
Learning. Here’s what he says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The secret to getting into the deep learning community is high quality
 blogging. Read 5 different blog posts about the same subject and then try to
 synthesize your own view. Don’t just write something ok, either — take 3 or 4
 full days on a post and try to make it as short and simple (yet complete) as
 possible. Re-write it multiple times. As you write and re-write and think
 about the topic you’re trying to teach, you will come to understand it.
 Furthermore, other people will come to understand it as well (and they’ll
 understand that you understand it, which helps you get a job). Most folks
 want someone to hold their hand through the process, but the best way to
 learn is to write a blogpost that holds someone else’s hand, step by step
 (with toy code examples!). Also, when you do code examples, don’t write some
 big object-oriented mess. Fewer lines the better. Make it a script. Only use
 numpy. Teach what each line does. Rinse and repeat. When you feel comfortable
 enough you’ll then be able to do this with recently published papers — which
 is when you really know you’re making progress!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rachel Thomas, who is a Ph.D. in Math, a professor at USF Data Institute and is
very well known as the cofounder of <a href="https://fast.ai">fast.ai</a>, has the <a href="https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045"> following to say
for blogs </a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s like a resume, only better. I know of a few people who have had blog
posts lead to job offers!</p>

  <p>Helps you learn. Organizing knowledge always helps me synthesize my own ideas.
One of the tests of whether you understand something is whether you can
explain it to someone else. A blog post is a great way to do that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, those are excellent reasons for me to start blogging already, but I’ve an
additional whip from our very own <a href="https://janusworx.com/">Mr. J. Braganza</a> looming over my head
waiting to crank down on me the moment I stop writing, so I rather prefer to
continue!</p>

<p>Thanks again <a href="https://janusworx.com/">Jason</a>!</p>
