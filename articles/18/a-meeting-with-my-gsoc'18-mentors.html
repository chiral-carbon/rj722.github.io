      <h1>A meeting with my GSoC'18 mentors</h1>
<p class="subtitle">May 13, 2018</p>

<p>Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn. This
blog post is a public memoir of an online meeting I had with my GSoC mentors.
Kudos to me for having such awesome mentors! :P</p>

<!--more-->

<p>So, a few days back I see some sudden activity in
<a href="https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture">vulture</a> with a lot of questions and
ideas from the legendary <a href="https://github.com/AbdealiJK">@AbdealiJK</a>. I had
already known him because of his contributions to <a href="https://coala.io">coala</a>. But
to my surprise, a week down, I come to know that he is mentoring me for my GSoC
project: <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5620743946108928">“Automatic Whitelist generation for
vulture”</a> along
with <a href="https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture">@jendrikseipp</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/The-Compiler">@The-Compiler</a>.</p>

<p>Now, since we wanted everyone to be on the same page and catch up with the
developments in the project, we planned to have a kick off call. All of us
quickly marked our free time on a <a href="https://doodle.com/poll/hn5dibfgz2y63ssa#calendar">doodle
calendar</a> and thereby decided
to have the call on May 4 (08:00 PM). In the meanwhile, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/westandwithamu">a protest caught up
momentum in my college</a> and seeking
to it, government shut down Internet services in my town, Aligarh on May 4 (The
nuances of it’s repercussions are yet to be lamented by). While, I was somehow
still being able to surf the Internet, I quickly notified Abdeali and asked for
his number so that if I couldn’t access Internet, I would notify him through
SMS. But, it must have been a bad day for humanity for not only did I lose
Internet, I had such an abrupt network connection in my mobile phone, that
sending an SMS took a couple hours.</p>

<p>It was bound to happen, but I was lucky that exams were postponed from May 7 to
May 12, and that we could reschedule the meeting to happen on May 7 now. Yay!
:-)</p>

<p><em>May 7, 7:30 PM</em>: I’m all set with audio/video equipment and make a hangout call
to my friend to ensure that everything was indeed working. (Thanks
<a href="https://github.com/proishan11">@proishan11</a>)</p>

<p><em>May 7, 7:35 PM</em>: I’ve already joined the call. Eagerly waiting for everyone!</p>

<p><em>May 7, 7:48 PM</em>: I e-mail the hangout link to everyone and create a Google doc
for notes and share it with everyone.</p>

<p><em>May 7, 7:55 PM</em>: Florian joins the call, tells me that he is sitting a
StarBucks cafe right now and that he was on mobile and that he would be joining
the call right back with his computer.</p>

<p><em>May 7, 8:00 PM</em>: Abdeali and Jendrik join the call, and that point marked the
point where we embark on our journey of GSoC 2018. Let me walk you through it.</p>

<h2 id="gsoc-kick-off">GSoC Kick-off</h2>

<p>As soon as they join the call, we have a casual conversation about t-shirts,
protests and politics all the while we were waiting for Florian to join the
call.</p>

<p>We start with have a round of introduction:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Abdeali:
    <ul>
      <li>We should call him Ali.</li>
      <li>Works in a startup based in Bangalore, India.</li>
      <li>Have had been a GSoC student twice.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Jendrik:
    <ul>
      <li>Based in Basel, Switzerland</li>
      <li>Completed his PhD in Artificial Intelligence from University of Basel.</li>
      <li>Currently a postdoctoral researcher at the same place.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Florian
    <ul>
      <li>Software Engineering Student</li>
      <li>Maintainer of <a href="https://github.com/qutebrowser">qutebrowser</a></li>
      <li>Has very long hair. (&lt;3)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After the introductions, we discuss about what common communication medium
should we use and finally arrive on a consensus that we should be using mailing
lists for elaborate discourse and IRC (#vulture on irc.freenode.org) for more
real time dialogue.</p>

<p>We then have a brief discussion about examinations, vacation plans, etc. to mark
our availability. I also became a subject of pity when I told them the truth of
my monotonous life: No Vacation, No pilgrimage! :-( (I really should plan a
vacation!)</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, Jendrik notices that someone has had been taking notes in the
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TltVoSFNxfjuiKTM8tnYmMllc6Z7GfmvJNIePWKgp6M/edit?usp=sharing">Google
Doc</a> -
We find out that it’s Florian. I am totally taken aback by his ability to
listen, process, speak and type at the same time. Hats off! - It is one of the
reason that I’ve started learning touch typing.</p>

<p>After a few more rounds of discussions, following verdicts are pronounced:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No dedicated traces, use coverage.py output</li>
  <li>Have the coverage tracing thing in the same repository as vulture</li>
  <li>But use a different repo for the whitelist generator.</li>
  <li><strong>Jendrik does not have exams and is very happy about it.</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>After all of this crazy fun for 40 mins, it was time that we bid each other good
bye. But all in all, it was a great experience (and productive) to be finally
able to meet with mentors and to see some faces behind the names. :-) Thank You
everyone for making this possible.</p>
