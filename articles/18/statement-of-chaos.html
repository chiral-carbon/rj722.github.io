<p>Should I go for a job or an MS?</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="tldr-why-the-title">TLDR; Why the title?</h2>

<p>Because I am in that phase of life where I need to take one of the most
important decisions of my life and it turns out that my thoughts are a chaos.
Let’s compare the things I know v/s the things I don’t:</p>

<p><strong>I know what I can do</strong>*</p>
<ul>
  <li>Contribute to open source more often.</li>
  <li>Write more regularly.</li>
  <li>Start looking for ideas for my research.</li>
  <li>Finish all the MOOC’s I’ve lined up.</li>
  <li>Start implementing the pet project I’ve been thinking for months.</li>
  <li>Read more books.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>I don’t know what I would do</strong>*</p>

<p>Do I go for a job after B.tech? If yes, then do I need to do something
differently from what I am currently doing?</p>

<p>or, should I rather go for higher studies - MS, Robotics? If yes, then does the preparation requires that I need to abandon some of the things I’ve listed.</p>

<p>Is the preparation for the above two mutually exclusive?</p>

<p><strong>Moreover, I don’t know what is stopping me?</strong>
<em>Is it lethargy?</em></p>

<p>Do I not want to do these things? Nope, it’s the exact opposite, I don’t want to
do anything other than these things. I can dedicate any (or all) amount of my
free time doing these things.</p>

<p><em>Am I too busy?</em></p>

<p>Nope, the workload from College is pretty less. Apart from hanging out with a
few friends, I don’t really do much.</p>

<p><em>Do I not put in enough efforts?</em></p>

<p>No, I try every bit I can to achieve these things, I wake up as early
as 5:30, don’t have a girlfriend, no TV, no movies.</p>

<p><em>Do I not have enough resources?</em></p>

<p>No, I have more than enough resources at hand - I have a fast Internet
connection, a powerful computer and access to powerful servers for anything
power savvy. I have god friends to support me and wise teachers/mentors to
advice me.</p>

<p>_Am I just slow?**</p>

<p>Yes, probably.</p>

<h2 id="is-it-the-first-time-you-are-confused">Is it the first time you are confused?</h2>

<p>Every career related decision I had to take up until now, I never really had to
sit and think. They just came naturally, take the example of:</p>

<p><strong>What stream after High School?</strong>
Biology - Nope, can’t look at blood.</p>

<p>Arts - My sense of art is “horrible”, not very good with social sciences
either.</p>

<p>Commerce - Although I like it, I wasn’t very fond of finding mistakes in
other people’s calculation.</p>

<p>Mathematics - Hell yeah, let’s go study it.</p>

<p><strong>What college do you want to go to?</strong></p>

<p>I was already a student in the Aligarh Muslim University when I applied for
B.Tech program and my rank elsewhere was average, so it was the only option.
I like the city, my friends are here - I feel like I did no mistake.</p>

<h2 id="did-you-always-wanted-to-pursue-higher-studies">Did you always wanted to pursue higher studies?</h2>

<p>Nope, I never even thought of pursuing higher education. With the advent of
MOOC’s and the Internet, I thought that I would never need formal training.
But, soon enough, I was introduced to the field of autonomous robotics and
MOOC’s weren’t able to satisfy my hunger, perhaps because it requires
practical/physical exposure. At this time, I just had a faint, out of
nowhere idea of an MS, but I wasn’t very serious. When no one around me was
getting a job I thought we can get, I started to take this idea into
consideration.</p>

<p>When the results for the third semester were out, a month ago, before entering
my name into the website, I thought to myself about planning my reaction and
almost naturally, yet passionlessly, my brain spurred out that I am ready to
accept whatever I had expected (~ 8 ± 0.2). There need not any “resolutions”
wherein I would try working harder the next time or to attend more classes,
because what I believe today “Mr. Busy effect” - I won’t be able to give time
to other things I (like to) do (contribute to open source, mentor new folks in
AMU-OSS, study robotics, write blog posts, read). I also thought that I ain’t
learning in class anyways, so my current way of studying (don’t ever open your
book in regular days and cram everything the night before the test) was the
“optimum” choice.</p>

<p>Ready for results, with absolutely no enthusiasm, I entered my credentials into
the website and kept staring at it. I was trying to calculate how precarious
life can turn out to be - I had scored a whooping 9.4 / 10 (my highest ever in
college) and I was actually feeling happy (maybe it was shock, I’m not sure).
The next few moments, I critically examined my result only to find out that I
have got a few A’s in the subjects I thought I never would and quite ironically
I also scored a B in a subject I thought I never would! ;-) I had “my moment”
then and there, but soon everything faded away in the color of life.</p>

<p>Not until, I had started preparing myself for this (4th) semester’s mid-term
tests, I realized that somewhere inside me, I had started to feel that I want
to score high again, I want to study for exams - What if I scored low again? -
What about MS?</p>

<p>This is where I started feeling confused. Can I afford an MS, would I be
selected, am I too late?</p>

<h3 id="solutions-i-thought-of-when-researching-for-this-post">Solutions (I thought of when researching for this post)</h3>

<p>Although I don’t have answers to all (or any) of my questions, it turns out
that writing this blog post gave me some clarity on the situation:</p>

<p>I should read more on the topic, especially Quora.</p>

<p>I am not late, it is the ideal time to start preparation.</p>

<p>that I need to go out there and get things done, no more infinitely long
“thought drills”</p>

<p>Also, that if you decide to take one step ahead and you would definitely
find a way to a solution.</p>

<p>Thank You for reading! - I’d highly appreciate your advice!</p>
