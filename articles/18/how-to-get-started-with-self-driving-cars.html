      <h1>How to get started with self driving cars</h1>
<p class="subtitle">January 11, 2018</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I’ve asked myself (and Google) this question numerous times and have always
learned something new in the process which in turn has lead to a superficial
learning of autonomous technology — helping me getting a taste of it, but for a
deeper knowledge on the subject, I must complete courseware, develop some
projects for hands on experience and in the process network with people who have
seasoned this art who can help me get a better insight on the current trends in
research and industry.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="courseware">COURSEWARE</h2>
<p>I’ve completed my home work of figuring out a Coursework for conquering the
world of Self Driving Cars:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="deeplearning.ai">Deep Learning specialisation</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://in.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-for-robotics--cs373">Artificial Intelligence for Robotics</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://in.udacity.com/course/intro-to-artificial-intelligence--cs271">Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-parallel-programming--cs344">Intro to parallel Programming</a></li>
  <li><a href="cs231n.stanford.edu">CS231N</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/mobile-robot">mobile-robot</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/underactuated-robotics-mitx-6-832x-0">Underactuated robotics</a></li>
  <li>https://www.udacity.com/apollo (Yet to start)</li>
</ul>

<p>I haven’t included the Udacity self driving car Nanodegree program (although, it
is a great resource) because it is quite expensive. Every course listed here
is either freely available or can be audited free of cost as of January, 2018.</p>

<h2 id="projects">PROJECTS:</h2>
<p>This is actually the most exciting and important part, as not only do I gain
hands on experience on how things work here and the workflow involved, but it
also allows me to build a portfolio around automotive technology which, I can
then showcase to the potential employers.</p>

<p>It is important to take note of the fact that laying down a clear goal of a
project before you start it yields better results and agreeably, it’s easy to
track progress if you quantify things. For example, if your todo list currently
says - go on morning walk, a yet more effective way of saying this would be -
Within 30 minutes of waking up, walk 1.5 kms. Therefore, I’ll try to be as clear
as possible when posing a project statement.</p>

<p>So, here’s the list of the projects I want to complete in the process:</p>
<h3 id="develop-a-brain-for-a-self-driving-car">Develop a brain for a self driving car</h3>
<p>A neural network is to be implemented from scratch (no copy-pasting - typed
in by hand) to spit out steering angle, gas and breaks given a frame of a
road scene.</p>

<p>It is encouraged to take help from related research papers.</p>

<p>Any framework - TensorFlow, Torch, Caffe, etc may be used to implement this
neural network.</p>

<h3 id="autonomous-driving-agent-for-gta-5">Autonomous Driving Agent for GTA-5</h3>
<p>GTA-5 in itself provides a rich environment for simulation and developing a self
driving vehicle for the game would be quite educating and challenging.</p>

<p>Implement a neural network which can completely navigate itself around on a
particular road in GTA-5.</p>

<p>You may retrain your prior project for the same!</p>

<h3 id="a-completely-self-driving-rc-car">A completely self driving RC car</h3>
<p>It should be able to drive itself on any track (a circular one, no navigation
decisions required), after 10 laps of training.</p>

<p>The car should drive itself completely autonomously for at least 10 mins, and
preferably until battery dies.</p>

<p>Use whatever tech stack - donkey, Apollo, etc and hardware you wish to use.</p>

<p>Complete this project with a physical car, not in simulation.</p>

<p>It’s okay to collaborate with others on the project.</p>

<p>Plus, there would be lots of fun projects I’d be implementing from the
curriculum of the various courses.</p>

<h2 id="some-extra-fun-to-dos">Some extra fun TO-DO’s:</h2>

<p>Participate in the diyrobocar races, you can even participate in the upcoming transit olympics.</p>

<p>Join slack channels for donkey and Self Driving Car Nanodegree program from Udacity.</p>

<p>Try and make your friends interested in the same - we learn better in a group and grow better as a community.</p>

<p>Go to meetups, network with like minded people and learn with them.</p>

<p>I am pretty excited to dive in — let’s see how this would turn out to be!</p>

<p>I’ll keep you updated with detailed reports on projects I make.</p>
