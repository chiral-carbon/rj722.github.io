<p>Trying to change my habits in a way it feels fun!</p>

<!--more-->

<h1 id="how-i-wish-to-change-my-life">How I wish to change my life?</h1>

<p>The past week had been pretty busy. To accompany this line, I would also like to
say that I feel like I spend way too much time on my laptop (feeling busy) but
not getting too much done correspondingly! :-(</p>

<h2 id="i-want-a-change">I want a change</h2>
<p>It’s time now — I am not gonna let this cut down my productivity, I will have to
learn time management, and to make sure that this happens, I am gonna experiment
some major changes in my routine.</p>

<h3 id="getting-back-to-books-again">Getting back to books again</h3>

<p>I have started listening to the book: Happiness of Pursuit</p>

<p>Recently, an article from <a href="https://medium.com/@maxdeutsch">Max Deutsch</a> caught
my eye — (How to build a self driving car in one month) — which lead me to
follow most of his work and to this book. This guy amazes me in every way
possible — He reads books (a lot). He blogs (a lot) in a lot detail about
everything he does. He cycles. He programs. He follows his passion [a lot**.</p>

<p>I also have gotten the book: Peak — Secrets from the new Science of Expertise.
It’s in my listening list as well.</p>

<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>

<p><a href="http://coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">Learning how to learn</a> 
Started this course - I always wanted to do this course, but never found time
for this. It’s amongst my top priorities now.</p>

<h3 id="documenting">Documenting</h3>
<p>Blogging - It helps me to introspect my activities, so I will be changing my blogging
habits, though I want to achieve one blog/day,I will be aiming at one blog every
2 days for now. Also, inspired by Max Deutsch! I find his blog to be an unending
source of knowledge, practical experience and inspiration. Thank You Max Deutsch</p>

<p>Challenging my limits - I will take M2M (Month to Master) challenge this year.
According to Max, M2M is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I will spend the next year trying to master twelve expert-level
skills — devoting one month to each skill and writing daily about the process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m calling the project Month to Master (M2M). I haven’t thought of challenges
as per, but you will most likely hear about it my next post.</p>

<h2 id="past-days">Past days</h2>

<p>Now, coming back to past days — the reason~s~ behind these developments: my
to-do list had been accumulating ever since starting of this month. It feels
like I don’t have enough time, but now, when I think of it - I have had enough
time! Everything I had in there fell more or less in one of the following
topics:</p>

<h3 id="running-stackgen">Running StackGen</h3>
<p>Reference: https://github.com/hanzhanggit/StackGAN</p>

<p>A neural network which converts text -&gt; images. You just need to write the description and you would have an image prepared. How cool is that!!</p>

<p>One of my seniors showed me their video, since then, I was tempted to make this thing work on my machine and see by myself. I spent nearly 6 hours trying to make it work in every possible way, but since my computer doesn’t have a NVIDIA chip, it won’t run CUDA and hence this didn’t run. But still, I learned many things in the process. :-)</p>

<h3 id="coala">coala</h3>
<p>Getting back on coala
Reference: https://coala.io</p>

<p>I am selected with coala for Google Summer of Code 2017. Though, I am keeping up with my schedule, I have some PR’s which were abandoned since I had been busy with exams and then, other stuff. I stated working on one of them, and man, rebasing it was quite hard, especially when one tries to rebase coala with a remote upstream pointing towards coala-bears ;) — Since, I was getting a lot of conflicts, I even wrote a script for skipping patches ;P. I noticed the mistake after digging for 30 mins. That was one hell of a facepalm moment.</p>

<h3 id="hacking-on-vulture">Hacking on vulture</h3>

<p>https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture</p>

<p>I have some issues pending, but I am pretty sure I can catch up on them. I have had already done a pretty good amount of research.</p>

<h3 id="todoman">todoman</h3>
<p>Configuring todoman - https://github.com/pimutils/todoman</p>

<p>todoman is a simple command line todo list manager, I have been using it for few
months now and it’s pretty great. I am also trying to contribute to it.</p>

<p>After I changed my machine, I wasn’t able to color-code my lists, at first,
thought I was doing something wrong, but after re-checking, I finally posted an
issue — In fact, while writing this, I tried to open it in iTerm2 (to which I
switched today ). it’s all colourful and I am happy again. :-)</p>

<h3 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Helping my friend setting up her website</li>
  <li>My best friend has been trying to contribute to coala. I have been helping her.
She is doing pretty great!</li>
  <li>Shutting Down my computer  —  I haven’t ever shut it down since it came! ;)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-lesson">A lesson</h2>

<p>What I think I did wrong was that I took up all these tasks simultaneously which
resulted in a lot of chaos. I found more and more interesting things to do ( A
different post ) — It was overwhelming. At a time, I had had more than 100 tabs
opened in over 4 windows.</p>

<p>Then, I got up at 3PM today (I slept at 7 AM), and since then doing a clean
up — reading/replying to all the emails. and closing all the tabs. After 12 hrs
of deliberate work, I am trying to get things done. :-)</p>

<h2 id="next-post">Next Post</h2>
<p>What to expect in my next post?</p>
<ul>
  <li>My study plan for this summer</li>
  <li>M2M challenges I would like to take up</li>
  <li>A list of interested things I want to do</li>
</ul>

<p>PS: My spacebar seems a bit weird sometimes :/ , I suspect this might be either
because of the posture in which I work sometimes or it might be a manufacturing
defect.</p>

<p>I am just skeptical ;p</p>

<p>I am on a macbook air, if anyone has had any such experience, please share! ;-)</p>
