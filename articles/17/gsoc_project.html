<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The motivation, here, is to extend the functionality of vulture as a library,
and to pass on all metadata through the API and then to harness this utility in
VultureBear for auto removing dead code, which would greatly optimise the bear.
The second part of this project focuses on offering the source range of the dead
code which would make auto-removal much easier. As of now, vulture only supplies
the beginning of the dead code. Also, it proposes to enhance vulture in order to
detect unreachable code (like <code class="highlighter-rouge">if False</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">if True else</code>, any code written after
return statements, etc). - this shall help the user in trimming down their
codebase without affecting usability. Also, the third part would be to implement
a confidence value for every result, this shall be helpful when tackling false
positives.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Modify vulture, such as to extend its core functionality as a library.</li>
  <li>Refactor VultureBear accordingly for ensuring optimal performance.</li>
  <li>Implement a method to acquire the source range of dead code and make suitable
changes in the API and Bear.</li>
  <li>Detect the instances of unreachable code, like `if False** statements</li>
  <li>Analyse and implement a confidence value for results.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="specifications">Specifications</h3>
<p><strong>1.) Realise vulture’s API in VultureBear</strong>*</p>

<p><strong>Extending vulture’s API</strong>: This would allow the user to find all the unused
	code through a single abstract layer: <code class="highlighter-rouge">get_unused_code</code>. Strategy here
	would be to:
Parse all files straight away from dict(filename: filecontent) - This
would highly improve the performance of the bear later due to the time we
save of memory copying.</p>

<p>Return a sorted list of tuples <code class="highlighter-rouge">[(item.filename, item.lineno, item.typ,
item)...]</code> - which would be easily configurable. This can be easily implemented,
given the already existing <code class="highlighter-rouge">Vulture.scan(), Vulture.report(),
Vulture.unused_funcs()</code>, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Enhance VultureBear</strong></p>

<p>Refactor VultureBear to directly fetch results through <code class="highlighter-rouge">get_unused_code</code>
(API), thus making it more efficient- we would have memory files passing
(An extra layer of parsing would then be removed)</p>

<p>Further enhancements in vulture (detect unreachable code and reporting
ranges of dead code** would influence the API, which would also need
refactoring of the Bear.</p>

<p><strong>2.) Making whitelist default and extending it further</strong></p>

<p>The first step here would be to make the whitelist default. The important thing
would be to identify possible cases which might cause vulture to report a false
positive. This can be achieved through extensive testing with major projects -
trending python projects on github would cater to our need for the purpose. This
approach would serve us many benefits:</p>

<p>We can identify instances of what should ideally be in our whitelist file - as
we may find any lesser known constructs.</p>

<p>We can test vulture for any unreported bugs.</p>

<p>We can find many projects which use/might want to use vulture - they may
further collaborate with us in making the whitelists together. (As proposed by
<a href="https://github.com/jendrikseipp">@jendrikseipp</a>**</p>

<p><strong>3.) Acquiring source range and implementing auto-removal</strong></p>

<p>Analyse and discuss with the community the utilities of ast or enhanced pyflake
ast for what would better cater to our problem and would offer simplicity for
source-range acquisition and arrive at a concrete conclusion. Also, there was
another proposal by <a href="https://bitbucket.org/m0hawk">@m0hawk</a> to get everything
until the next node starts. Dialogue here -
<a href="https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture/issues/25">#25</a></p>

<p>Also, if able to fetch the source range successfully, implement the pathway
through which the metadata flows in and out of API, this would not require much
work because we can easily change item.lineno (int) to item.dead_range (tuple of
ints** and can parse them over in the VultureBear.</p>

<p><strong>4.) Detecting unreachable code</strong></p>

<p>We would first need to identify cases where code cannot be reached. Some of the
common ones are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">If False</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">If True; else</code></li>
  <li>Any code after <code class="highlighter-rouge">return</code> statement in the block containing return itself.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">raise</code> statement in `try** block.</li>
</ul>

<p>Similar constructs would have to be looked onto. The crude form of this would
be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Analyse the ast’s</li>
  <li>Look for the if nodes</li>
  <li>Check the boolean affiliated to it, tracking previous arguments.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5.) Implementing a confidence value for  results</strong></p>

<p>We would need to analyse every construct individually on a case by case basis.
For example, we already know that import statements can be predicted with 100%
surety (except for * imports, where it would be 0%), but functions often have
false-positives.</p>

<p>The confidence value will be alike the ones given below: (The finer grained
distinctions will need further discussion)</p>

<p><label for="table-1-id" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="table-1-id" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><em>Table 1</em>: A table with default style formatting </span></p>
<div class="table-wrapper">
<table class="table-alpha">
<col align="middle" />
<col align="right" />
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Construct</th>
    <th>Confidence Value</th>
  </tr>
</thead>

<tr><td>import </td>          <td class="r">100%</td></tr>
<tr><td>from foo import *</td><td class="r">0%</td></tr>
<tr><td>variable</td>         <td class="r">&lt;100%</td></tr>
<tr><td>function</td>         <td class="r">&lt;100%</td></tr>
<tr><td>class</td>            <td class="r">&lt;100%</td></tr>
<tr><td>if False</td>         <td class="r">100%</td></tr>
</table>

<h3 id="milestones">Milestones</h3>

<p><strong>PREPARATION/BONDING</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>A concept for the source range acquisition is finalized.</li>
  <li>Use vulture to report dead code for popular Python projects on Github</li>

<ul>
  <li>Create whitelist files for popular Python frameworks like Django</li>
  <li>Refine default whitelists for vulture</li>
  <li>If a way was found to offer source ranges, the removal of dead code is

</ul>

<p><strong>CODING PHASE 3</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Implement additional detection cases for unreachable code</li>
  <li>Update the API to easily transmit newly created data (confidence values,
unreachable code, source range, etc.)</li>
  <li>Integrate the resulting API with the VultureBear</li>
  <li>All implemented code is fully tested and documented.</li>
</ul>
