<p>Challenging my limits - Completing 4 ridiculously difficult programs in a year.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><strong>TMP — Tri-Month-Pack program</strong></p>

<h2 id="what-exactly-is-a-tri-month-pack">What exactly is a Tri-Month-Pack?</h2>

<p>TMP is a challenging program similar to M2M (Month to Master) by <a href="https://medium.com/@maxdeutsch/">Max Deutsch</a>.
Hereby, I shall complete four herculean 3-Month goals, designed in such a way that their progress can be numerically monitored and that they have a specific target rather than an abstract concept (like “Being able to run at 18 km/hr for 20 mins straight without break” and not “Being able to run fast”).</p>

<p>The four projects are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sep-Nov:</strong> Developing GhostTime: An anonymous social network.</li>
  <li><strong>Dec-Feb:</strong> Developing an Introspection Tool which helps you monitor your schedule.</li>
  <li><strong>March-May:</strong> Developing an AI system which can generate good, high quality music.</li>
  <li><strong>June-Aug:</strong> Achieving a national rating of less than 1000 on <a href="https://codechef.com">codechef</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<p><strong>Q. Why are you doing this?</strong></p>

<p>Because I am an avid learner and maintaining accountability in this way would help me avoid procrastination and ultimately help me in learning much more effectively.</p>

<p><strong>Q. How did you come up with this list?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>GhostRider</strong></p>

    <p>My dear friend A.V .I. came up with the beautiful idea of having an anonymous social network and from then onwards I have been praising the idea. I would love to see it a reality.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Schedule Visualiser</strong></p>

    <p>I have a habit of procrastination and find myself wasting too much time writing, analysing and drawing my routine. I always wanted to automate it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>AI Music Generation</strong></p>

    <p>It came up in a casual conversation with one of my friends while discussing neural networks and the idea stuck to me from then on. Also, I am learning about Machine Learning and this would be a beautiful application. ;-)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Competitive Programming</strong></p>

    <p>Having been contributing to open source projects for a while now have made me familiar to the process of Software Developement, but I still consider my Computer Science skills to be subpar. Competitive Programming provides a great way to ensure that I keep on track.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q. How much time will you be spending working on these projects?</strong></p>

<p>I am an Engineering student at Zakir Hussain College of Engineering and Technology, AMU and there would be examinations, assignments, community activities, co-curricular participation nearly during every project. I also appreciate OSS development and hack actively on <a href="https://github.com/coala/coala">coala</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture">vulture</a>. Other than this, gym also takes up some of my time daily.</p>

<p>I prefer to work on these projects on leave-days and week-ends and during my free time.</p>

<p><strong>Q. How do you plan to monitor your progress?</strong></p>

<p>I shall monitor my progress by writing a brief journal entry in the form of a Blog Post everyday. Also, I shall keep track of what’s going on through a private gitlab repository which shall have respective milestones much like https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC-2017.</p>
