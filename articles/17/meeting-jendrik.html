<h1 id="coding-period-kicks-off">Coding period kicks off</h1>

<p>A quite has happened since I last wrote, most important of which was a meeting with my mentor <a href="https://github.com/jendrikseipp">@jendrikseipp</a>, which by the way went awesome. Thank You! @jendrik</p>

<h2 id="a-meeting-with-my-mentor-jendrikseipp">A meeting with my mentor @jendrikseipp</h2>

<p>A little overview - In the starting of the session, we had already discussed
that we would be meeting weekly on Wednesdays at 3ish PM UTC +2:30 on
hangouts, but due to some circumstances we couldn’t meet prior June 7.</p>

<p><strong>Wednesday, 7 June 2017</strong>- I was feeling a little nauseatic, so I decided to take a short nap (which later turned out to be of 4 hours ). When I woke up, it had already been past 7 (in my timezone UTC +5:30) - Oh! I missed the meeting again, I thought, it had been quite a bad day, so this was kind of expected :cry:. But I thought it would be better if I could atleast update the doc which we maintain for our meets. I quickly penned down some points I thought would be better if Jendrik took a look and also drafted an email stating the same.</p>

<p>Just a couple of seconds later, he messaged me, saying if he could call me in 10 mins. I was excited and nervous both at the same time, and replied with a text stating it would be great indeed (Finally). I went upstairs to the rooftop - the only place you <em>might</em> get silence in an Indian joint family :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:. Waiting meanwhile, I browsed through Jendirk’s G+ profile, saw that he is currently studying at University of Basel, Switzerland, probably doing PhD - I read some of the blog posts about the student life over there and immediately fell in love with it.</p>

<p>When I picked up the phone call, to my surprise, it was a video call - I wasn’t presentable <strong>at all</strong> (I thought that this would be a voice call). While looking at my screen, I can see there is a handsome guy, dressed up nicely ,in his cabin, and me on the other hand, was somewhere in the dark, and was shabbily dressed perhaps food deprived for a few days (atleast, I imagine myself that way) - I am very sorry @Jendrik, I would be presentable the next time you call me ;P . Quickly, I ran into my room and caught my breath. We exchanged greetings and then Jendrik asked me about how was everything going? To my surprise (I am quite talkative), I couldn’t speak anything - I knew exactly what to, but just couldn’t - I was quite nervous, but since Jendrik sounded nice and rehearsed, the conversational flow went very well :-). We talked about a wide variety of topics ranging from VultureBear to college life, coala and what not.</p>

<p>To conclude, Jendrik is quite an astonishing guy and that it was a thrilling experience to talk to him. I had a conversation that is amongst the most cherished ones of my life. I am looking forward to our next meeting.</p>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">coala</code>
    <ul>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">coala</code> is a smart code linter - It finds problems in your code and even proposes a patch to fix them. It has primary processors called Bears - They contain the logical part whereas the infrastructure is provided by coala.</li>
      <li><a href="https://coala.io">coala</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">vulture</code>
    <ul>
      <li>It is a dead code reporter - It reports unused variables, functions, classes, etc.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture">vulture</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">VulturBear</code> is a coala bear which finds dead python code by running vulture over it.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>

<p>How <code class="highlighter-rouge">VultureBear</code> currently worked:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It runs a shell command: <code class="highlighter-rouge">vulture filename1.py filename2.py ...</code> where filenames is provided by coala.</li>
  <li>It then captures the output.</li>
  <li>Analyses the output through <code class="highlighter-rouge">re</code> catching every line of result for getting the <code class="highlighter-rouge">filename</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">lineno</code>, type of entity(function, variable, class, etc.)</li>
  <li>Creates a Result Object</li>
</ul>

<p>This implementation had several issues:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It creates a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Popen</code> instance.</li>
  <li>It uses <code class="highlighter-rouge">re</code> to analyse the files and their asymptotic complexity may rise exponentially.</li>
  <li>If vulture tweaks the way results are displayed, <code class="highlighter-rouge">VultureBear</code> won’t be able to cope up with this.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-current-implementation">The current implementation</h3>

<p>Taking a closer look at vulture, I found that there is a utility provided by vulture which would do just the same thing in a much more cleaner way:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">vulture.Vulture.scavenge(filenames)</code> and this would store all the relevant info (lineno, filename, etc.) in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">vulture.Item</code> object.</p>

<p>Implementation of a wrapper around this can be like this:</p>
<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">_retrieve_unused</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">filenames</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="s">"""
    :param filenames: List containing paths to all the files
                      which are to be checked by vulture.
    :return: List of Result objects containing information about
             dead code (filename, lineno, message).
    """</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">file_lineno</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">item</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">unused</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="a-note">A note:</h3>

<p>When I first tried this implementation, all the things seemed to be in place, except for this <code class="highlighter-rouge">AttributeError: 'Vulture' object has no attribute 'unused_imports'</code>.</p>

<p>After half an hour of debugging and scratching my hair, suddenly the <code class="highlighter-rouge">PipRequirement</code> version of <code class="highlighter-rouge">vulture</code> caught my eye: <code class="highlighter-rouge">0.10.0</code> whereas current version of coala is <code class="highlighter-rouge">0.14.0</code> and then it occured to me - Oh! God! may be this wasn’t introduced in this version of vulture, quickly upgraded to latest version and everything worked like a charm.</p>

<h2 id="my-laptop">My Laptop</h2>

<p>I finally managed to buy a new Macbook Air. Yay!
Previously, I was using a Dell Inspiron Mini Netbook - Intel Atom, 2 GB RAM, 10.5 inches screen and a tampered keyboard, and absolutely no battery life.
I am crazy happy. :-)</p>
