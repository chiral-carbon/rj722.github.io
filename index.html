we (the Vulture team) underwent to integrate Vulture with

functions which Vulture reports as unused but are actually being used.</p>

          <div><p>It isn’t uncommon for software developers to encounter some code that they had
written in the past and reflecting on it - the most common reaction would
probably be “It must be the most horrible thing I wrote”. But sometimes, there’s
that aha moment where you find something and you are instantly gratified and
proud of yourself, “Oh, this is so beautiful, no wonder it took so many
sleepless nights”. However glamorous it may sound, but it is indeed a difficult
task to write and maintain such code, and this is where automatic tools come in
to the picture. Let’s discuss about one such tool - <a href="https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture">Vulture</a>, which
helps discover unused stuff in Python code.</p>

<p>So, today we present to you the voodoo which throws out unused code.</p>

<p>Getting selected as a Google Summer of Code student with coala was a
breakthrough for me. The coala community touched me on every aspect of open
source software development, especially how to get along with peers (and troll
them :-p). And it has happened again - I am a student with coala one more time,
and I look forward to learn yet more from my dear mentors and the beloved coala
community.</p>
